# Portfolio Project 1

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

# Catmosphere 

 

This site is intended to display the establishment of Catmosphere cat café, what goods and services they provide and how to contact the business. 

 

Catmosphere is a fictional café based in Dublin, Ireland.  
The premises provides a foster home for rescued cats and kittens while also serving food and drinks to generate income to fully support the animals welfare. 
The website is a way to connect to possible guests to see what the café is all about and to book a meeting with the cats while also supporting animal protection charities and educating people on the subject of animal welfare.

## Features  

 

The site is broken into 4 main pages being Home, Gallery, Menu and Book in. 

Home – This page holds a brief introduction and a house rules section, explaining how guests should prepare before arriving to Catmosphere. 
There is also two call to action sections; Menu and Book in. Clicking on these sections brings the user to the respected page. 

 

 

Gallery – This page includes a collage of images showing the interior of the café, the inhabitants and some of the products available. 

 

Menu– This page displays the available products and the prices.  
 
Book -In – This page includes a form to complete and secure a booking by adding in the customers details, party size, time and date, preference in cat and additional comments. 

 

### Navbar and Footer 

 

- __Navigation Bar__ 

 

- The navigation bar features the site logo which brings the user back to the home page, the page title and links to the Home, Gallery, Menu and Book In page.  

- The color scheme was chosen to be as calming as possible and not too bright. 
I believe the cream background compliments the burnt umber text coloring nicely and hints towards the cream of a coffee or a cappuccino . 
The font “fredoka one” was taken from google fonts and was selected because it looked comfortable and friendly.

- __Footer__ 

 

- The footer includes the social media links in the form of logos from fontawesome.com, with a background of coffee beans to suggest that the contents of the social media links will include more café insight. The style of the footer appeared neat so I did not add anything further, although I would like to include a more intricate footer in future projects.

## Testing  

__Internal Links__ 

- The page links are both in the navbar of the page but also featured in the home page sections dividing the page.  

- The navbar links are tested page to page to ensure each is directing to the correct page. 

### Validator Testing
